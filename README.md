# README

This is a simple amp site.

It seems like only when accessing to an amp page on Google Chrome it would send multiple GET requests in background without specifying its content type.

It doesn't happen to Firefox or Safari.

Weird.

# Setup

```
$ git clone git@github.com:FumiyaShibusawa/amp-sample.git
$ bundle install
$ rails s
```
